# Vegetable Pot Pie

6 servings

## Filling

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 2 large or 4 small shallots, chopped
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
- 1/4 cup flour
- 2 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 3 cups Broccoli
- 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
- 1/2 cup frozen corn, thawed
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

- Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. 
- In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the butter, shallots, carrots and thyme to the saucepan. Cook for about 6 to 8 minutes until the carrots are tender.
- Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Increase the heat to high. Add the broth and scrape up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until the mixture thickens, about 3 minutes.
- Add the heavy cream, broccoli, peas, corn, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 3 minutes until heated through. Using a ladle, fill the ramekins with the filling mixture.

## Crust

- 3/4 cup flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1/4 cup cornmeal
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/3 cup buttermilk, plus extra, as needed
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- Special equipment: 6 (10-ounce) ramekins, each 2 1/2 -inches tall and 3/12-inches in diameter. A 3-inch round cookie cutter

## Directions

- In a food processor, pulse together the flour, cornmeal, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Add the butter and cheese and process until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. With the machine running, add 1/3 cup buttermilk and the oil. Process until the mixture begins to form a ball, adding extra buttermilk, 1 teaspoon at a time, if needed. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 10-inch diameter circle, about 1/4-inch thick. Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut the dough into 6 circles and place on top of the filling.
- Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.
