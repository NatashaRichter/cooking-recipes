# Broccoli Potato and Cheese Soup

Serves 6 big bowls

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 tbsp ghee (or butter at some other quantity)
- 3 tbsp flour
- 2 cups milk (2%)
- 3 cups water, broth, whey
- 5 potatoes, peeled and diced
- 2 heads of broccoli in small florets
- 3 stalks of celery 
- 1 jalapeño (more could be used)
- 1/4 - 1/2 tsp asafetida (hing, I don't like onion so this is my replacement)
- 1/4 - 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/4 turmeric (you can omit, adds a nice color)
- dash of nutmeg + cinnamon
- 2 tsp salt (could be reduced)
- pepper to taste
- 2 cups mozzarella (or any other cheese, adjust measurements as desired)

## Directions

- Heat ghee over medium high heat. Add the diced celery and jalapeño, cook for 3-5 min until soft.
- Add the hing and turmeric, sauté for 30 seconds. Add the flour and stir until the mixture is smooth. Cook momentarily.
- Add all the liquids, potatoes, salt, turn to high heat, stir frequently until it reaches a boil. Reduce to a low (simmer) add nutmeg / cinnamon, cover and cook for 10-15 min stirring occasionally.
- Add the broccoli and cook for an additional 5 minutes uncovered.
- Remove from heat, either us an immersion blender or remove small quantities and use a blender to pure 1/4 to 1/2 of the soup. Add back to pot, add cheese and pepper.

## Notes

All the recipes I found online were filled with leeks :(. Replacing the leeks with hing was fine, however I was a little over zealous and used ~1tsp. I also didn't have any butter (as I had transformed all of mine into ghee!) so I just used that. This could have gone well with a touch more nutmeg / cinnamon. Alternatively, I am sure rosemary / thyme would make a good alternative. Overall, this was a very rich soup. It could be toned down some... I don't have potato soup often tho, so this was nice :D
