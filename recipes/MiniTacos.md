# Mini Tacos

Making Hard Taco Shells

<http://www.emilybites.com/2011/02/mini-taco-bowls.html>

#### Basic Premise
Take any flour tortilla shell, warm it normally in the microwave for 30 sec with a damp cloth. Preheat oven to 375. Hang tortillas over two of the prongs or invert a cupcake pan and place them in the folds.

#### Steps
- Preheat oven to 375
- Warm tortillas in microwave for 30 sec. with damp cloth
- Sprinkle shells with sea salt (any other spices you want)
- Spray shells lightly with cooking spray
- Place in oven the desired way, cook for 6-10 min.


#### Idea
Make the 6" shells, then make layered taco bowls.
Refried Beans > Rice > Guacamole > Lettuce > Cheese > Cherry Tomatoes
For seasoning, toss the shells with hing, sea salt, and black pepper.
You could replace the guacamole with sour cream if desired.
