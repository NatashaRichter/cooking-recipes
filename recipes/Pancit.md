Pancit
======

### Ingredients:

- 2 cups of carrots, cut into strips
- 2 cups of green beans, cut into strips
- 2 cups cabbage, cut into strips
- 1/2 cup celery, cut into small bunches
- 1/2 package of pancit (rice noodles)
- Vegetable broth (or water)
- Soy sauce
- Hing (optional)
- Crushed peanuts (optional)
- Lime (optional)
- Jalape単os (or some other spicy pepper)
- Black Pepper

### Prep:
- Soak the rice noodles in luke warm water between 15-30 min, cut into small chunks when done
- Shred: carrots, green beans, cabbage
- Dice: jalape単os, celery


### Directions:
In a large pan, use ~2-3tbs of oil and fry jalape単os with a splash of soy sauce. Cook over high heat till soft. Remove from pan, and set aside.

In the same pan, add carrots, green beans, and cook over high heat with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce (to start), a little broth, and pepper. When they are almost cooked through (10-15 min), add the celery, cabbage and cook until cabbage is soft (7-10 min). Add soy sauce and pepper to the desired amount, should be a nice medium tan. If the pan gets dry, sprinkle more liquid to make sure it can continue steaming. 

Add the noodles while on low heat, adding soy sauce as needed. Cook to combine.

Put this on a platter with the jalape単os and peanuts on top as garnish. You can add lime wedges around the side of the dish if a citrus flair is desired.

### Notes:
- If using an entire pack of pancit, make sure to scale the amount of veggies added. 
- For a little bit of protein, add some tofu.
