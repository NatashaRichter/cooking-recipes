# Chickpea Curry

**Notes:**
This dish orrigionally calls for Chat Masala but is replaced with Chana Masala if desired. (MDH brand, small dark green carton).

##Ingredients

- 1.25 cups chickpeas, soaked overnight, drained and rinsed, then cooked. They cook pretty fast in the pressure cooker. After they are butter soft but not mushy, drain them but retain some of the liquid in a separate container

*OR*

- 2.5 cups canned and cooked chickpeas, drained

- 5 tomatoes

- Chana Masala Spice Blend

- Coriander Powder

- Turmeric 

- Red chilli powder

- 2 medium Jalapeno

- 1-2 inch piece ginger, peeled and grated

- Cumin seeds

- Mustard Seeds

- 10-12 Curry Leaves, very finely chopped

- Oil

- Some ghee

- Salt


## Recipe

1. Dice the tomatoes.

2. In a pot, add some oil. Add 1-2 tsp of mustard seeds. Once they pop, add 1-2 tablespoons cumin seeds.

3. Once they brown, add the finely chopped jalape√±os, grated ginger and chopped curry leaves. Fry for 1 minute maybe. 

4. Add the chopped tomatoes. Turn the heat to high until the sauce begins to thicken. Then on a medium/ medium high flame, wait for it to become very thick, add 1 tsp or so of turmeric, a sprinkle of red chilli powder, 1-2 tsp of coriander powder and mix on moderate heat.

5. At this stage, if you have chana masala powder, add 1-2 tablespoons. If you don't have this masala, add a sprinkle of black pepper now and some lemon juice once the dish is ready.

6. Cook this sauce on moderate heat for a couple of minutes. Then add the drained chickpeas. Mix. Add a little of the reserved liquid or water, add the salt and bring to a boil. 

7. Once the dish has the consistency you like, add some melted ghee.
