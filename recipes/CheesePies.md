# Cheese Pies

## Pie Dough

### Ingredients:

- 3 cups of flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dry active yeast
- 1/4 teaspoon of sugar
- 1/2 cup of mazola corn oil or vegetable oil
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- Warm water (about 1 cup but use half a cup at a time)

## Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water. Mix well. Cover the bowl with a dish and set it aside for several minutes, allowing the yeast to proof (until it foams).  In a separate bowl, combine the flour and salt.  Make a well in the center of the flour. Pour the yeast mixture into the well, followed by the olive oil.  Using one hand, quickly mix and knead the ingredients to form the dough. If the dough seems sticky, dip your hand in some flour to remove the dough that is sticking to you.  Use both hands to lift the dough out of the bowl and touch and shape it into a ball, Sprinkle flour around the sides and bottom of the bowl and place the ball in the center of the bowl, Sprinkle the top of the ball with some flour. Cover the bowl with a dish and set it aside in a warm place to rise. (you can put it in the oven and turn the oven light on. Dont turn the oven on because it will cook the dough).  After 1 hour and 15 minutes, the dough is ready to roll.  Take spoon fulls of the dough and spread them on a hard surface.  Roll the spoon full of dough to make a circle about 3 inches in diameter.  Put the filling inside the circle and pinch the sides into 4 small pinches.  Bake in a pre-heated oven at 375 for about 15 minutes.

## Filling

### Ingredients:

- 1 cup feta cheese crumbled
- parsley cut up (optional)
- 1 tomato diced
- Olive oil
- Za'atar

### Directions:

Mix all the ingredients and taste the filling.  If it tastes good and is not too runny/juicy, then the it is ready to be used ;-) if it is too juicy, use a slotted spoon so that when you put the filling inside the dough it does not become soggy. 

### Notes: Za'atar is generally prepared using ground dried thyme, oregano, marjoram, or some combination thereof, mixed with toasted sesame seeds, and salt, though other spices such as sumac might also be added.
